# Spatial Hack starter — context for coding agents

One-day hackathon (World Labs × Tripo × mint.gg × Convex). Goal: ship a 2-minute demo by 6 PM. Bias to working code over abstractions.

This repo holds two halves: the **capture CLI** (`scripts/`, `tests/`) that turns a
phone capture into a World Labs room, and the **web app** (`src/`, `convex/`) that
renders it. `README.md` covers both; `HACKATHON_PLAN.md` has the product architecture.

## Read first
- `HACKATHON_PLAN.md` — product concept, architecture review, scope decisions
- `docs/ROOM_CREATION_WORKFLOW.md` — capture → world pipeline, people removal
- `docs/00-hackathon-prep-sheet.md` — event, tracks, judging, idea list, day plan
- `docs/01-worldlabs.md` — Marble World API (worlds → .spz splats + collider .glb), Spark renderer
- `docs/02-tripo.md` — Tripo v3 API (text/image → GLB, rig, convert). URLs expire in 5 min.
- `docs/03-mint.md` — mint.gg API/MCP + Three.js agent skills
- `docs/04-convex.md` — Convex concepts, components, multiplayer rules

## Stack
Vite + React 19 + TypeScript · react-three-fiber + drei · `@sparkjsdev/spark` (Gaussian splats) · Convex (backend, storage, realtime).
All third-party API calls happen in **Convex actions** (`convex/worlds.ts`, `convex/assets.ts`) so keys stay server-side. Generated assets are cached into Convex file storage; the client only ever loads Convex storage URLs.

## Commands
```
npm install
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-media.txt   # capture CLI media helpers
npm run world -- credits                           # World Labs CLI (needs WORLDLABS_API_KEY in .env.local)
npm test                                           # capture CLI + Convex/client integration tests
npx convex dev                     # first run: login + create deployment, writes .env.local
npx convex env set WLT_API_KEY ... ; npx convex env set TRIPO_API_KEY ... ; npx convex env set MINT_API_KEY ...
npx convex env set OPENROUTER_API_KEY ...          # optional: sketch orientation (see below)
npm run dev                        # convex dev + vite
```
Multiplayer test: open two tabs at `http://localhost:5173/?room=test`, click "join multiplayer" in both.

## Conventions
- Coordinates: Marble splats/colliders are OpenCV (+y down) → `scale=[s,-s,-s]` (via `worldTransform` in `SplatWorld.tsx`). Metric scale via `metricScale`/`groundOffset`, read off the world document — never hardcode them.
- GLB loading: always through `gltfLoader` in `src/components/Asset.tsx` (Draco + meshopt decoders attached).
- Multiplayer: one doc per player, ≤5–10 Hz mutations, lerp remote players. Never send per-frame mutations.
- Generation is slow (Tripo 10–120s, Marble 1–5 min): kick it off early, show status in UI, never block the render loop.
- Keep the demo path (`src/App.tsx`) working at all times; put experiments behind `?feature=` flags.

## Capture integration
`src/App.tsx` hosts the Galatea capture entry and three-second demo transition, then
hands off to `src/WorldApp.tsx` — the first-person room viewer. `src/lib/ConvexProjectClient.ts`
bridges saved CLI manifests and `readWorldZip` results into Convex storage via
`api.worlds.importUploaded`. Demo entry opens the stage room bundled at `public/room/`
(manifest + full-res splat + collider, byte-identical to the `stage-rear-2026-09-05`
release), with indexed provider-world-ID lookup and duplicate prevention; it does not
generate from the selected capture. Lookup matches `splatFileName` as well as the world
ID, so the same room imported at another resolution is not reused in its place. The URL's
`world` is the Convex ID and default room ID; legacy `job` URLs import through the same
bridge.

Root `vite.config.ts` serves only saved `/world-assets/` files, for those legacy `job`
URLs. `web/src/` is legacy code, not a second active viewer. The bundled room is the only
room binary in Git; a fresh backend imports it on first entry, and anything else needs the
saved local assets under `data/worlds/` or a ZIP import.

## The room viewer (`src/WorldApp.tsx`)
Navigation is first-person (`LocalWalk.tsx`: pointer lock, WASD/arrows, Q/E, Shift) — there
is no OrbitControls. Room geometry, the object library, placements and players all come from
Convex; nothing is stored in IndexedDB.

There are two modes and `H` is the whole switch between them: walking and drawing. Escape
drops pointer lock for the side panel (the browser does that itself); clicking the canvas
takes it back. `LocalWalk` ignores movement keys while `paused`, because placement rebinds
Q/E — do not remove that guard.

- Placement: `src/lib/surfacePick.ts` raycasts the Marble collider for a real triangle
  normal (inverse-transpose normal matrix, flipped toward the camera) and falls back to two
  probe rays against the splat. `plane` is disabled — a miss places nothing rather than
  inventing a depth. Do not "simplify" this; it is what makes objects land on tables.
- What that normal *means* is `src/lib/placementPose.ts`: floors stand the object up, walls
  put its back against them with world-up preserved, ceilings hang it. There is no override
  and no offset — the object sits exactly on the picked point, on whatever the cursor is over.
  `poseOnSurface` is called by the ghost preview and by the click that commits it, so the two
  cannot disagree. Splat normals are noisy, so they only count as a wall below `|n.y| < 0.35`.
- Editing a placed object *is* placement: clicking one (crosshair while walking, or the free
  cursor) re-arms it through the same `PlacementGhost` and it re-orients to whatever is under
  the cursor, like any other placement. Q/E turn, `[`/`]` resize, `R` resets the turn, Enter
  commits, Esc cancels.
- Sizes: `fit.ts` normalizes every GLB so its longest dimension is `targetSize` metres and
  its bottom-centre sits at the anchor. `PlacementGhost` and `Asset` run identical maths,
  so a committed object does not jump.
- Sketching: `DrawingLayer` freezes the frame; `drawingPlacement.ts` raycasts the base of the
  ink to a real surface (the centroid of the ink resting on it, not the bounding-box corner)
  and stores that contact point, the `orientOnSurface` rotation, the camera matrices and the
  strokes themselves. `fitDrawing` replays the matrices to estimate a size. While the mesh
  builds, `SketchGhost` hangs the ink alone back in the room on the quad `drawingQuad`
  unprojects from those same matrices; the cutout rides in the `localStorage` job entry and
  survives a reload, and over `STROKE_BUDGET` it is dropped rather than risking the quota.
- A finished mesh is **placed automatically** at its anchor — no click — then selected and
  pushed onto the undo stack, so the hanging `SketchGhost` (hidden once `jobPlaced`) dissolves
  into the real object in the same spot. `arm`/`PlacementGhost` remain for the library's Place
  button, for Move, and as the fallback when no pose can be derived.
- Sketch orientation: Klein re-poses the cutout into a centred product view, so the only record
  of the drawn viewpoint is the user's ink. `src/lib/sketchPose.ts` owns the whole decision as a
  three-rung ladder, each rung falling to the next on any failure — read it before changing any
  part of this:
  1. **Vision — opt-in via `?vision=1`, off by default.** `SketchSolver.renderViews` renders the
     mesh at 8 yaws as one numbered contact sheet, `renderInk` redraws the strokes, both upload
     to Convex storage, and `convex/orientation.ts` asks a vision model through OpenRouter which
     view matches. It is the rung that works when the mesh *isn't* a faithful likeness of the
     sketch — common, since Tripo builds from Klein's reinterpretation rather than from the ink
     — but two uploads and a round trip per object is too much latency to spend by default on
     top of a generation pipeline that already runs one to two minutes.
  2. **Chamfer.** `sketchOrientation.ts` (pure, injected renderer) chamfer-matches the ink
     against silhouettes swept by `SketchSolver`. With a `window` it searches only the sector
     the vision model picked; without one it sweeps the full circle and applies its confidence
     gate. `alignToBox` scales *uniformly* — the silhouette's aspect ratio is the yaw signal, so
     do not stretch it to fit. When no yaw beats the median by 15% the object is rotationally
     ambiguous.
  3. **Face the camera** — the yaw `orientOnSurface` already gave the anchor.
  `composeYaw` post-multiplies about the object's own +Y, the same convention as
  `poseOnSurface`'s manual yaw. Both renderers share one tiled render target and a single
  readback inside `<Canvas>`, and `renderAtlas` must restore every piece of renderer state it
  borrows — the viewport especially, or the whole app renders into a corner.
- The vision rung needs `?vision=1` **and** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` on the deployment. Without the
  flag it is skipped silently (a normal placement); with the flag but no key the card says
  orientation matching is unavailable. `OPENROUTER_VISION_MODEL` overrides the default
  `google/gemini-3.8-flash` (~$0.005/sketch) with, say, `anthropic/claude-opus-5`.
  `convex/orientationResult.ts` holds the schema, prompt and a deliberately tolerant parser,
  with no Convex imports so `node --test` can exercise it.
- Undo/redo is an inverse-operation stack (`src/lib/placementHistory.ts`), not array
  snapshots: placements are shared, so replaying a snapshot would revert other players.

## Sketch -> object pipeline
`assets.startSketch` (mutation) validates keys, inserts the row, returns its id and
schedules `internal.sketch.run` (`"use node"`). That action reuses the CLI modules
verbatim — `scripts/image-benchmark/providers.mjs` for fal Klein + BiRefNet,
`scripts/glb-assets.mjs` for `inspectGlb`/`modelArtifact` — plus `convex/tripo.ts`, which
is a copy of the four Tripo helpers from `scripts/image-to-stl.mjs` (copied, not imported,
to keep three.js out of the Convex bundle). `convex/pipeline-modules.d.ts` types both JS
modules. Progress is patched onto the asset row, so the client watches it with `useQuery`
instead of polling. STL export runs in the browser (`src/lib/stlExport.ts`).

**The demo does not generate.** `convex/demoAssets.ts` holds four objects that were
generated for real earlier — couch, table, flower vase, dinosaur — keyed by word-boundary
keywords (`sofa`, `desk`, `flowers`, `t-rex`, …; first one named in the sentence wins). When
`startSketch` matches one it inserts a normal asset row and walks it through the real stages
on a fixed clock — image 0s, cutout 2.5s, mesh 5s, pulling the mesh 7.5s, ready at 10s — then
points the row at the saved GLB, so the card, the orientation solve and the auto-placement all
run unchanged. Anything else still generates for real, and `?live=1` turns the stand-ins off
entirely (the demo path then needs the keys below). The curated asset IDs are per-deployment;
a deployment without them falls back to the newest ready library object matching the same
keywords, and failing that the card says the demo object is missing.

Needs `FAL_KEY` and `TRIPO_API_KEY` in the Convex environment. The Tripo endpoint here is
`api.tripo3d.ai/v2/openapi`, not the `openapi.tripo3d.ai/v3` one used by the older
`assets.generateFromText`/`generateFromImage` actions.

## Where to extend
- NPC/agent: `npm i @convex-dev/agent ai @ai-sdk/anthropic`, enable in `convex/convex.config.ts`, add `convex/npc.ts`.
- Presence UI: `npm i @convex-dev/presence`.
- Physics/walking: `npm i @react-three/rapier`, use the collider GLB as a `TrimeshCollider`.
- First-person controls: drei `PointerLockControls` + raycast against `userData.collider` meshes for ground height.
- Mint assets: install `mintdotgg/mint-threejs-skills` and use `mint-assets.json` + sync script per the skill.
