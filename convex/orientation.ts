// "Which way round should this object go?" — asked of a vision model through OpenRouter.
//
// The geometric answer lives in src/lib/sketchOrientation.ts: it chamfer-matches the user's ink
// against silhouettes of the mesh at a sweep of yaws. That works only when the mesh's outline
// resembles the drawing, and often it does not — Tripo builds from Klein's *reinterpretation*
// of the sketch, so the two shapes genuinely differ and pixel matching turns to noise.
//
// A vision model is asked something easier and more robust: of these numbered views, which one
// faces the way the sketch does? That is semantic rather than pixel-wise, so it survives the
// mesh not being a faithful likeness. The client renders the views (the GPU is over there) and
// this action does the asking (the key lives over here).
//
// Raw fetch rather than a provider SDK: OpenRouter is OpenAI-compatible over plain HTTP, which
// is how worlds.ts, assets.ts and tripo.ts already talk to every other provider, and it keeps
// this action in Convex's default runtime with no "use node" and no dependency to install.
